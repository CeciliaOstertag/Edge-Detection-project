# Important notes:

* Taveau wants ONLY scientific articles or books in the bibliographical section. No Wikipedia or websites (except, of course, websites giving direct access to aforementioned books or articles)

[ ] Taveau promised a Repository we could fork with the relevant file structure, but has yet to give one. We need to contac him and check.

[ ] We need to check which algorithms exactly we are to study/implement. what is in a "classic" image analysis toolbox other than the default 3 ?
