# 1.Introduction

* *talk about the importance of image analysis and creating efficient tools for it.*
* *Introduce the general information on the project (name, main goal, 3 steps)*
* *Talk about our part (edge detection) and what kinds odf edge detection exist (1. simple derivative max finding 2. secondary derivative Zero finding 3.?)*

# 2.Material & Methods

* *description of the main algorithms and their implementation in ImageJ.*

## Sobel

The Sobel Opertator, introduced in 

## Canny

## Laplace

## ??

# 3.Results

* *examples of the image processing and a benchmark of the features of the different algorithms.*


# 4.Discussion

* *comparison of benchmarks of different implementations, ways to improve them (probably more towards the second month)*

# 5.Conclusion

* *hmmm... no idea what we'd write here, really.*
*Something about which algorithm turns out to be the most efficient already existing in ImageJ for the first month, and a theory as to why that is ?
For the second and third month, I'd guess we compare the performance of our scripts (qualitative and quantitative for both the pure JS and the WebGL versions) to the implementations in ImageJ and see how well we've implemented them, and try to explain why one implementation seems to work much better than another (most likely WebGL ?)*

*we need to agree on a syntax to follow for the references. I propose trying to separate them according to theme, keeping them in order of apearance in each theme, then reordering it all afterwards with the required [x] notation, where x is whatver number we assign to the reference.
